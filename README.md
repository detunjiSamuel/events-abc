# Features

#### 1. Event Store

>  Events stored in memory 

#### 2. Streams

Events are kept in streams. One stream is used to hold all related events..

#### 2.1. Snapshots

The event store also offers snapshot support. Snapshots function as event checkpoints. Streams are similarly preserved as snapshots..

### 2.2 Event Versioning
